Blackboard Theme
================

This is a simply naked theme, it has minimal HTML and as much of the WordPress native functionality as I've come to need.

#This project is focused for developers because it has no styles and design at all so it's an open canvas to built your theme upon.
#It's optimized for HTML5 as it validates properly and I've tried to enforce the use of HTML5 best standards.
#Comes with a comprehensive CSS breakdown that also happens to contain a lot of the WordPress default CSS styles based on the classes it renders.
#It has most of the theme templates that WordPress allows to provide you with a solid start-up point.

The effort is by no means a complete idea yet but I plan to continue updating this theme as my needs continue to grow because I make this project for me but I also share it because it might work for you.

Changelog
================

2.0
*Just released.
*Note that GIT was started at version 2.0 because I was keeping my own lame version control before and I recently thought of turning this into a project for everyone else to use.
